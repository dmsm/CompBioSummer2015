        <p>
            <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> (Reconciliation Browser) is a tool for browsing the potentially large landscape of
            maximum parsimony reconciliations (MPRs) of pairs of phylogenetic trees (e.g., species and gene trees or
            host and parasite trees). This tool is based on algorithms and techniques described in the paper “DTL-RnB:
            Algorithms and Tools for Summarizing the Space of DTL Reconciliations” by Weiyun Ma, Dmitriy Smirnov, Juliet
            Forman, Annalise Schweickart, Carter Slocum, Srinidhi Srinivasan, and Ran Libeskind-Hadas (under review).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> takes as input a pair of undated phylogenetic trees in <a href="/documentation">newick
            format along with their tip associations</a>. <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> rompts the user for non-negative
            costs for duplication, transfer, and loss costs (speciations are assumed to be null events and are set to
            cost zero) and a method for scoring events (see “Scoring Functions" below). The tool then displays a
            sequence of maximum parsimony reconciliations that, collectively, come close to maximizing the total sum of
            the scores of the events with respect to the given scoring function. For example, if all events have unit
            scores, then the tool seeks to find a small set of maximum parsimony reconciliations that include as many
            events as possible from the set of events found in all maximum parsimony reconciliations for the given
            input.
        </p>

        <p> More formally, <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> seeks to solve the following <em>k-Reconciliations Cover
            Problem</em>:
            <br>
            <strong>Input:</strong> A pair of phylogenetic trees, a mapping between the tips of the trees, DTL event
            costs, a scoring function that assigns a non-negative score to each event in found in any
            maximum parsimony reconciliation, and a parameter <em>k</em>.
            <br>
            <b>Output:</b> A set of <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations that maximize the sum of
            the event scores. (Note that an event score is only counted once in this sum, but the same event
            may still appear in more than of the <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations.)
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we have shown that this problem is NP-complete, <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> uses
            a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that is guaranteed to find solutions that are within 1
            - 1/e (approximately 0.632) times optimal. In other words, if the optimal solution could
            “collect” OPT points using <em>k</em> maximum parsimony reconciliations, our algorithm will
            collect at least 0.632 OPT points. The algorithm is based on an existing approximation algorithm
            for the Maximum Coverage Problem.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-info"> Scoring Functions </h3>

        <p>
            <strong>DTL-RnB</strong> currently supports three scoring functions, although many others are possible and
            can be added by modifying the available source code.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Unit:</strong> Each event in the reconciliation graph has a score of 1. Thus, the kRCP problem
                seeks to find <em>k</em> reconciliations that include as many events as possible in the
                space of MPRs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Frequency:</strong> Each event in the reconciliation graph is scored by its frequency, namely
                the number of MPRs that contain that event divided by the total number of MPRs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Region-Based:</b> This function scores each event with its robustness with respect to
                perturbations in event costs using our <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~xscape">Xscape</a> tool.
                The underlying idea is that an event that occurs in many MPRs in a specified range of
                “nearby” event costs should have a high score and one that occurs in fewer MPRs in that
                range should have a lower score. Since event costs are unit-less, we assume that the cost of
                duplication is normalized to 1 and the cost of transfer and loss are relative to this
                normalized duplication cost. Given an original set of DTL event costs (1, T, L), we first
                compute the space of MPRs using Xscape. Next, given two parameters x and y, we compute the
                regions for transfer costs ranging from T - x to T + x and for loss costs ranging from L - y
                to L+y. For each such region, we compute the set of events that arise in the MPRs in that
                region. Then, for each event, its score is the total number of regions that contain that
                event. Finally, we normalize scores to be between 0 and 1. Ultimately, a score of 1
                indicates that this event occurs in at least one MPR in every region in the given range
                whereas a score close to 0 indicates that the event occurs in relatively few other regions.
                Note that this scoring function assigns a strictly positive cost to every event since every
                event occurs in some reconciliation in the region corresponding to the original event costs.

        <h3 class="text-info"> Making the Images Bigger </h3>

        <p> Reconciliations are displayed in .svg format. In large trees, it may be hard to see the details (e.g., event
            types, scores, and taxa names). The images can be downloaded (e.g., by using CTRL and clicking on the image)
            and then viewed in an image viewer where they can be magnified. We recommend using <a
                    href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to first convert the image into
            jpeg format.</p>
